Freetype:

    The FreeType  2 font  engine is  copyrighted work  and cannot  be used
    legally without  a software  license.  In order  to make  this project
    usable to  a vast majority of  developers, we distribute it  under two
    mutually exclusive open-source licenses.

    This means that *you* must choose  *one* of the two licenses described
    below, then obey all its terms and conditions when using FreeType 2 in
    any of your projects or products.

      - The FreeType License,  found in the file  `docs/FTL.TXT`, which is
        similar to the  original BSD license *with*  an advertising clause
        that forces  you to explicitly  cite the FreeType project  in your
        product's  documentation.  All  details are  in the  license file.
        This license is suited to products which don't use the GNU General
        Public License.

        Note that  this license  is compatible to  the GNU  General Public
        License version 3, but not version 2.

      - The   GNU   General   Public   License   version   2,   found   in
        `docs/GPLv2.TXT`  (any  later  version  can  be  used  also),  for
        programs  which  already  use  the  GPL.  Note  that  the  FTL  is
        incompatible with GPLv2 due to its advertisement clause.

    The contributed  BDF and PCF  drivers come  with a license  similar to
    that  of the  X Window  System.   It is  compatible to  the above  two
    licenses (see files `src/bdf/README`  and `src/pcf/README`).  The same
    holds   for   the   source    code   files   `src/base/fthash.c`   and
    `include/freetype/internal/fthash.h`; they were part of the BDF driver
    in earlier FreeType versions.

    The gzip  module uses the  zlib license (see  `src/gzip/zlib.h`) which
    too is compatible to the above two licenses.

    The   files   `src/autofit/ft-hb-ft.c`,   `src/autofit/ft-hb-decls.h`,
    `src/autofit/ft-hb-types.h`,     and    `src/autofit/hb-script-list.h`
    contain code taken (almost) verbatim  from the HarfBuzz library, which
    uses the 'Old MIT' license compatible to the above two licenses.

    The  MD5 checksum  support  (only used  for  debugging in  development
    builds) is in the public domain.
